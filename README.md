# About
Being a big fan of retro games and arcade games, I decided to take on the challenge to fully restore a defunct, abandoned 1980's Corona arcade cocktail table machine. Since a lot of essential parts were missing including a screen, game board, and other controllers, I decided to use a Raspberry Pi 3 loaded with Lakka to bring new life to this vintage machine. This upgrade gives me the ability to play thousands of old games from SNES, N64, Gameboy, NES, Amiga, MAME, and countless other consoles and computers all while keeping the original vibe. 

## History of Corona and the Winners Circle Table

There is not much information out there about Corona and their arcade tables, so likely this company was very small or a local business that built their own arcade tables or rebranded generic ones. These arcade tables were used during the 80's arcade boom in bars as an alternative to standup machines. 

Winners Circle was a horse racing game based off the original board released by Corona in 1981 where you bet on seven horses over three races to win the most cash. Check out the video of some original gameplay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p2Suuga1zI).

# How It Started
This arcade table has been sitting in a garage in the middle of humid hot Louisiana and been through the 2016 floods. So when I recieved the table it was in very poor conditions, even with the missing parts it needed some serious TLC. My first steps was just to open up the machine, clean out dust and dirt, and see what I was working with and see what I can salvage for te final product.

# Rust Removal
The metal parts of the arcade table were very rusted and took some time to remove most of it without sacrificing the original paint. I used WD-40, wirebrush, emery cloth, and sandpaper to remove the rust. While for some pieces the chrome was partly removed, the new brushed metal finish already looks a lot better than when I got started.

# Retrofitting a Raspberry Pi
For the restoration, I decided to go with Lakka, a linux distribution built on top of RetroArch and LibreELEC for compatibility for many retro consoles and good performance on limited hardware. Lakka also has built-in wired and Bluetooth controller support so you can easily plug up multiple retro controllers for a unique experience. Also, since the Raspberry Pi 3 is small, it was easy to fit and secure inside the table. Check out this link [here](https://www.lakka.tv/get/). for installation instructions if you want to run Lakka yourself.

# Retrofitting a Monitor
For the monitor, I used an old Dell monitor that I salvaged from a friend of mine for this build. It is just the right size to fill the space where the original CRT screen was and makes for a lightweight addition. For mounting, I used 2x4 pieces of wood cut to length to mount onto the CRT screen mounting holes. I then used velcro to secure the screen on for easy removal. 

Since the screen has HDMI, this allows me to hook up any console or computer to the aracde table.
